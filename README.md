# A04 - 2b2t statistics

Find stats about your favorite players on the 2b2t minecraft server!

This program makes use of a 3rd-party minecraft API to find the skin and uuid of a player given their name. Then it will use a 2b2t API to find statistics about that player such as kills, deaths, and when they were most recently online. Simply enter a username into the box and press enter. Some usernames to try are *Notch, Negative_Entropy, l_amp, Pyruuuu*. 

I originally had loftier goals with this project, but unfortunately, my preferred API was not accessible for some reason giving me a `CORS policy` error.
